## Installation
The following technologies needed will be:
1. Vscode
2. Node.js
3. Package.json
4. Inquirer
5. Jest

## Tests
When using this application, users will have to run the command "node ." to prompt the questions about the manager first then prompt to the next category of asking whether to add an employee or not. Given the user chooses to add an employee, it will then take the user to a series of other questions and repeating until the users is done adding the number of employees they want. This will then exit the prompt of questions and create the team generator. 

For testing purposes to make sure the application works, jest was added into the library then a unit testing is then carried out. To make sure that all test pass the following command "npm test (filename)" will need to be executed to display whether the code passes or fails.
